reply: "Hi,\r\n\r\n​Welcome on board and thank you for wanting to help.\r\n​\r\nFor the time being we cannot assure that we will have free tickets for volunteers​, but we are trying to solve that. So you should buy your ticket ASAP.\r\nIf we manage to do it we will reimburse you up to the 90€, less operation costs charged by Ti.to and our bank.\r\n\r\n​Also, July is a problematic season for hosting and travelling to Lisbon. So if you want to use our hosting partners and official carrier TAP's discounts all info will be supplied in the email we sent you after the ticket purchase. ​You should do it ASAP.\r\n\r\nVolunteer work for now will be mostly spreading our tweets in you​r​ channels (social media, blog, whatever).\r\n\r\nDuring the ​event ​days we will use a telegram ​channel ​(subscribe it at https://t.me/joinchat/CtrBsRCSSOwIODUHIvup9w) to manage all the volunteer's work, Agile way.\r\n\r\nMost of the work involved will be to be present at the sessions, sprints, workshops to help in any way that is required (guarantee the speakers/moderators have the material needed, giving the mic to participants, helping to solve - or find someone that can solve - any tech issues that may arise), and also to help guiding people to the lunch area, helping them to go back to the session rooms, registering participants and other minor tasks. All with the less stress possible. We don't forget that you are there also to enjoy the event.\r\n\r\n​Best regards,\r\n\r\nLopo Lencastre de Almeida\r\nVolunteer Manager\r\n\r\n--\r\nAssociação Drupal Portugal\r\nhttps://drupal-pt.org | https://drupal.pt\r\n\r\nMail: lopoalmeida@drupal-pt.org\r\nSkype: humaneasy\r\nGtalk: humaneasy@gmail.com\r\nhttps://www.ipublicis.com"
